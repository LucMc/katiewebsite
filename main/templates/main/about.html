      <h2 class="mb-4">About</h2>
      <p>Final year student at the University of Leeds completing my Bsc in Zoology.
        As an individual I have always had multiple areas of interest.
        For example, despite being captivated by animals and the environment,
         I also enjoy learning about wider STEM subjects and business.
          When possible, I try to combine these, for instance I manage a personal
           investment portfolio where I only invest in companies geared toward sustainability.
            Similarly, I run a small business that promotes the recycling of second-hand clothes.
            Aside from these, I dedicate time each week to volunteering.
             Currently I volunteer for Leeds City Museum on a project to encourage females into STEM subjects.
